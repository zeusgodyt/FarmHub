# FarmHub
Farmer Market Place (Connecting Farms to Local Vendors)

## About the Project
FarmHub is a user-friendly platform designed to directly connect farmers with local vendors. By eliminating middlemen, FarmHub fosters transparency and ensures fair pricing for farmers while providing vendors with fresh, locally-sourced products.

The project begins with an onboarding page (onboarding.html), serving as the entry point to all interconnected pages.

## Key Features
Farmer Dashboard: Easy-to-use interface for farmers to list their produce and track sales.
Vendor Dashboard: Browse available products, place orders, and manage purchases.
Direct Communication: Enable real-time messaging or notifications between farmers and vendors.
