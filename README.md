# FarmHub
Farmer Market Place (Connecting Farms to Local Vendors)

## About the Project
FarmHub is a user-friendly platform designed to directly connect farmers with local vendors. By eliminating middlemen, FarmHub fosters transparency and ensures fair pricing for farmers while providing vendors with fresh, locally-sourced products.
